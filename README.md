# scala-csv

Parsing CSV files with Scala. This is a CSV parser written in Scala
in 10 lines. More an exercise to familiarize with the Scala toolchain
than a real project.

## Use it

Clone the project: 

```
# git clone https://github.com/juli1/scala-csv.git
# cd scala-csv
```

Run tests

```
# sbt
[ once in sbt ]
